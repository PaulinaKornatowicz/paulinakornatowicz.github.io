			<h4>Smart Home app</h4>
			<p>
				An Android app or controlling lights in apartment and in the future providing information about temperature both inside and outside the house.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app uses Particle SDK to connect to a Particle Photon device that controls the leds.
				The hardware for control of the leds was designed using Eagle software.
				The user can turn the leds on and off using a button.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further development:
			</p>
			<p>
				- switch to RGB leds and let the user choose the color of the leds along with color transitions
			</p>
			<p>
				- provide information about temperature using simple temperature sensors. Data should be collected using BLE (BLE connection in the app already tested, design of electronics in progress).
