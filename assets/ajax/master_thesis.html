			<h4>Study of concurrent image processing algorithms for a machine vision system</h4>
			<p>Master Thesis project developed during studies at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology (Advanced Applied Electronics).
			</p>
			<p>
				The aim of the master thesis was to design and configure a multichannel machine vision system with the use of SoC (system-on-chip) device, implement the algorithms for detection of multiple objects on FPGA and perform the efficiency evaluation od the created system.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was accomplished by using DE1-SoC Evaluation Board running Linaro Linux to acquire and analyze data from USB cameras connected to the board.
				The objects were detected by color and processed data was displayed on VGA screen. A web control panel was created for configuring the system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The machine vision project created on DE1-SoC is a simple one and is still in development phase. It will be used as a base for more complicated designs for further analysis of image processing mechanisms using SoC technology.
